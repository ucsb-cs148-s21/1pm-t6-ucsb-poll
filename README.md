# Installation
Prerequisites
TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before running the installation instructions below (e.g., git, which version(s) of your framework(s) of choice)

# Dependencies
TODO: List which libraries / add-ons you added to the project, and the purpose each of those add-ons serves in your app.

# Installation Steps
- Clone the repository
- set up Auth0 for this app
- cd into "myapp" and create a file called “.env.local”. This way you’ll be able to use Auth0 on localhost. That file should contain only these three lines, replacing the first set of Xs with the Auth0 domain, the second set with the Auth0 client ID, and the thrid set with the link to the heroku for this webapp:
- cd into myapp and run: 'npm install' and then 'npm run build'
- Go back into the root project directory and run: 'npm install' and then 'npm start' to run the project on localhost:8080. 

REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=XXXXXXX \
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXX \
REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=XXXXXX 


# Functionality
TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section, and showcase your features.

- click the login button in the top right corner of the webpage to login through Auth0.
- BOOKMARK

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
