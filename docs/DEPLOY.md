# Deployment

- **Clone the repository**
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:ucsb-cs148-s21/1pm-t6-ucsb-poll.git
    ```
- **Set up Auth0 credentials and heroku for this app**\
    Create a heroku deployment and link it to your repo. 
    Create an Auth0 account if you don't already have one.\
    Set up an Auth0 tenant for this webapp.
    This process can be pretty difficult unfortunately. There are detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/ucsb-cs148-s21/1pm-t6-ucsb-poll/blob/main/docs/AUTH0SETUP.md).
    
<!-- TODO: Summarize main Instructions from cs156? -->
- **Set up app with Auth0 credentials**\
    cd into "myapp" and create a file called “.env.local”. This way you’ll be able to use Auth0 on localhost. That file should contain only these three lines, replacing the first     set of Xs with the Auth0 domain, the second set with the Auth0 client ID, and the thrid set with the link to the heroku for this webapp:

        REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=XXXXXXX  
        REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXX  
        REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=XXXXXX 
- **Set up Firebase**\
    (Create project, initialize cloud firestore, copy config details, put in server.js file)     
    Create a new project on Firebase. \
    Initialize cloud firestore for this project. (Click on Cloud Firestore on the left hand nav bar, and then click on "Create Database") \
    Firebase will provide a set of config details. You can find them by going to project overview and clicking on the "< / >" or by going to your project settings under the gear icon and finding the < / > section.\
    These values will look like

```javascript
   var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "xxxx",
    authDomain: "xxxx",
    projectId: "xxxx",
    storageBucket: "xxxx",
    messagingSenderId: "xxxx",
    appId: "xxxx",
    measurementId: "xxxx"
  };
```
   Insert these credentials at the beginning of the server.js file, where firebaseConfig is located. Replace the current credentials with your own. 

- **Deploy To Heroku**\
        Push repository to GitHub and link to a new Heroku webapp.\
        Input environment variables for Auth0. Under settings --> Config Vars, input the three auth0 credentials key/token pairs REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN, REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID, REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE.
        
    <!--- set up express ? -->
<!--- - cd in myapp & npm run build? (Trouble shooting if heroku is not working properly) -->

- **Running on Local Host**\
    cd into myapp and run: 'npm install' and then 'npm run build'\
    Go back into the root project directory and run: 'npm install' and then 'npm start' to run the project on localhost:8080.\
    Note: You can run the front end and back end seperately too.
