# Problem Scenerio

A club at UCSB wants to have an event on campus. They want to gauge interest by polling UCSB students. The club tries using a Google Forms survey to find out who at UCSB is interested in the event. The club get very few responses because of the feasability of getting people to fill out the survey. 

UCSB Polls solves this problem by providing a fun and public method of polling UCSB students. Students are more likely to answer a poll they perceive as fun than a survey that they perceive as work.
