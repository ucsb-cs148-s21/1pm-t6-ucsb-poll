Hi, my name is TT, and I am a fourth-year majoring in computer science and minoring in music. 
For our project, we will use java and spring boot for the backend and use HTML, javascript 
and css for the front end. We will also use an SQL database. And after we finished the project 
maybe we can try to put our poll system on a blockchain.
