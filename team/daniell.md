I am Daniel Lohn, a second year student at UCSB studiying computer science. My ideas for the project are that any UCSB student can create/edit polls after signing in with their UCSB Google account, and then vote on polls created by other students. Students should be able to sort by the most popular (most votes) and most recently created poll.
