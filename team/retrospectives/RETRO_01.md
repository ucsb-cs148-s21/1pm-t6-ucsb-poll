## Action item

* a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
* a change: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
* a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team achieve the goal, or move closer to it.

**Goal:** Sprints should be more clear with concrete goals and deadlines \
**Change:**  Define our goals. What should be done by the end of a sprint.\
**Measurement:**  Number of user stories completed. 


**Goal:**  Kanban board and user stories should be more clear. \
**Change:** Minmize conflicting description, make sure everybody is on the same page about the kanban board, make sure the issues are workable \
**Measurement:**  At least one issue should be edited 

## Optional

## Retro Assessment
A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
- Start/Stop/Continue format and then picked the top actions to convert into action items. 

A brief assessment of how it went.
- Pretty well, I think we got a decent list of items and also got a good sense of how the group feels about the first sprint. 

What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
- Be more prepared to get other people involved in the discussion.
