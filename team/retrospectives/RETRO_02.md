* Led by: TT Luo
* Present: Daniel Shamtob, Zhengying Li, Daniel Lohn, Jasun Chen 
* Absent: 


## Action item

* a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
* a change: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
* a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team achieve the goal, or move closer to it.

**Goal:** Make better UI design\
**Change:** Get team idea on choosing the style of UI / the category,etc, do some market research, vote on the slack for the favored UI elements/designs.\
**Measurement:**  Approved by whole team

**Goal:** Being more explicit about who's doing what issues and progress and editing issues when acceptance criteria goals cannot or will not be met\
**Change:** Assign oneself to the issues during the development, more communication in slacks proving more progress updates(avoid conflicts), detailed sprint planning\
**Measurement:**  The deliverables can be finished on time

**Goal:** Improve code readability\
**Change:** indent the html code (automatic format helper: prettier), make necesssary comments, use explicit variable/file names\
**Measurement:**  Understood by other teammates



## Optional

##### Start
- Make better UI design, get team idea on choosing the style of UI / the category,etc.
- Being more explicit about who's doing what issues and editing issues when acceptance criteria goals cannot or will not be met.

## Retro Assessment
A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
- Start/Stop/Continue format and then exaimed and combined different ideas to goals.

A brief assessment of how it went.
- Pretty well, individual talked about their opinions for the development process and reflected to other's ideas.
- We had a mutual agreement on what we are going to do in the next sprint.

What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
- Be more prepared to get other people involved in the discussion.


## Retro Outcome Assessment

* A brief description of what your retro 2 experiment was 
 
Doing progress towards our three goals to make better UI design, be more explicit about everyone's role and assigned issues, and improve code readability.

* A brief recap of the metric you planned on using 

The UI design should be approved by whole team, be sure the deliverables for every team mates can be finished on time in every stage of development

and all codes should be understood by other teammates

* The outcome according to the metric now that the next Sprint is done (maybe already for a while).

UI design outcome has been met - poll results view has been approved and looks better. Everyone has clear roles and assigned issues. Code is more readable. 

* Your conclusions based on this outcome. You can decide to cement this change going forward, to modify it (start a new experiment), or to discard it and go back to previous procedures.    

Maintain changes because the outcomes are positive.
